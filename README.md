# jmutator

This is a tool to mutate Java bytecode (.class files). The input is a folder with .class files,
and the tool will produce several mutations (.class files) for each. The names of the mutations
can be specified using a simple template language. See examples for details. 

For each mutated .class file, a provevance file in JSON format is created that describes the mutations made.
[pitest](https://pitest.org/) is used as mutation engine. This should always result in valid bytecode, 
but the tool also has the option to run additional bytecode verification based on ASM as described [here](https://asm.ow2.io/javadoc/org/objectweb/asm/util/CheckClassAdapter.html).

## Requirements

Java 11 or better and Maven 3.9 or better (earlier versions of Maven might also work)

### Building

`mvn package`  , this will generate the executable `target/jmutator.jar`.

### Usage

```java
usage: java -jar jmutator.jar
 -b,--binaries folder <arg>           root folder containing .class files
 -j,--provenance pattern <arg>        a pattern used to name json-encoded
                                      provenance files, must contain the
                                      strings $n (the original class file
                                      name without extension) and $i (the
                                      mutation number, and int))
 -m,--mutated binaries folder <arg>   folder to write the mutated  .class
                                      files to
 -p,--conversion pattern <arg>        a pattern used to name mutated class
                                      files, must contain the strings $n
                                      (the original class file name
                                      without extension) and $i (the
                                      mutation number, and int))
 -v,--verify                          verify generated byte code
                                      (verification is ASM-based, will
                                      result in error if verification
                                      fails)
```
